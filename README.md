# RRT Algorithm

RRT or Rapidly Exploring Random trees is one of the most popular algorithms used for path planning for autonomous robotic systems.

Clone the repository, and then go into the working directory which will be named as "Robotics-Automation-main" on downloading from github.

## Dependencies:
Code tested for :
1. Python 3.11.4
2. Matplotlib version 3.8.2
3. Numpy version 1.26.2

Then you can execute the following:

cd <-path to working directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to run the code

In working directory, enter:
python3 rrt.py

1st choice will be to choose whether to implement code in pre-defined map or a custom designed map. Choose 0 for pre-defined and 1 for custom

Follow the steps given.

## Sample Runs
### Pre-Defined Map:
