# RRT Algorithm

RRT or Rapidly Exploring Random Trees is one of the most popular algorithms used for path planning for autonomous robotic systems.

Clone the repository, and then go into the working directory which will be named "Robotics-Automation-main" on downloading from Git Hub.

## Dependencies:
Code tested for :
1. Python 3.11.4
2. Matplotlib version 3.8.2
3. Numpy version 1.26.2

Then you can execute the following:

```
cd <-path to working directory->
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run the code

In the working directory, enter:
```
python3 rrt.py
```
1st choice will be to choose whether to implement code in a pre-defined map or a custom-designed map. Choose 0 for pre-defined and 1 for custom

Follow the steps given.
